                    I figure I'll start here with something of an introduction to myself, where I'm at in life, and what I'm looking to do next,
                    followed by a recap of my 2025 and how it plays into my intended next phase of things.

                    Starting near the beginning - in elementary school I came to enjoy math, noticing I had some talent for it, and also spelling.
                    The latter warrants a post of its own, so here I will keep it brief: over the next few years (really the only thing worth
                    noting from that period of my life) spelling was my big thing; I ended up tying for 11th in the Scripps National Spelling Bee
                    (twice). Immersing myself in words of all different origins as I did then partially stemmed from and also further drove my
                    interest in learning new languages. Over the following years I acquired some knowledge of Spanish (starting in elementary school),
                    French (middle school), and Arabic (college). I have interest in learning more.

                    Those interests carried over into college (the University of Minnesota), where I debated majoring in linguistics before deciding on 
                    math. I eventually tacked on a CS minor since it seemed prudent and somewhat interesting. It was on both counts. I took my first
                    CS class somewhat late though (summer after sophomore year), which hindered my ability to get internships after junior or senior years.
                    As such, my job search for after college ended up yielding a role at Epic Systems Corporation, makers of MyChart, doing a combination
                    of technical and non-technical work.

                    Epic is where I am now and have been for about a year and a half, working with healthcare organizations installing Epic as their EHR
                    to integrate with vendors who provide functionalities that Epic does not - think PACS, radiology reading services, nurse call systems,
                    etc. The experience has taught me a lot, and I feel I've gained what I'm going to gain here. Certainly there is more I could learn but
                    Madison has proven too small of a city for me, so I'm looking to the East Coast and hoping to find a role where I can further hone the
                    (transferable) technical skills I worked on in college, and the timeline I've decided on for that is shorter than what the timeline for
                    learning meaningfully more would be.

                    That is a decent summary of how I've gotten where I am. Let's now take a look at what 2025 did for me.
